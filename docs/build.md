# Build & Test from source

You can build onnc source with either [CMake](#building-with-cmake) or [Automake](#building-with-automake) building system.

# Building with CMake

There are 2 modes, [Release mode](#release-mode) and [debug mode](#debug-mode), provided in CMake building system. 

## Release mode

> Recommended for common use.

Release mode will build onnc with basic optimizations, and skip debug informations.

**Notice: Release mode will NOT build unit tests.**

### Step 1: Configure

```shell
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

It will create `build` directory, get into it and configure with `Release` build type.

### Step 2: Build

```shell
$ make -j4
```

It will compile sources with 4 threads concurrently. You can modify `-j4` option to meet your needs.

### Step 3: Install

```shell
$ sudo make install
```

It will install essential files to `/usr/local`.

## Debug mode

> Recommended for development use.

Debug mode will build onnc with debug settings, unit tests and some debug informations.

### Step 1: Configure

```shell
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

It will create `build` directory, get into it and configure with `Debug` build type.

### Step 2: Build

```shell
$ make -j4
```

It will compile sources with 4 threads concurrently. You can modify `-j4` option to meet your needs.

### Step 3: Test

```shell
$ ctest
```

It will trigger all unit tests by CTest.

If you want to execute single unit test, you can find it in `build/tools/unittests` directory.

### Step 4: Install

```shell
$ sudo make install
```

It will install essential files to `/usr/local`.

## Advanced configurations

You can override default configurations by simply add `-DENTRY=VALUE` options to the configure command. The `ENTRY` and `VALUE` can be replaced according to the following table:

"Path string" of value means you have to provide a string of a directory path, and "File path string" means you have to provide a string of a file path.

| Entry | Available values | Default | Description |
|-------|------------------|---------|-------------|
|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX| Path string | `/usr/local` | Path to install onnc into |
|CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE| `Debug`,`Release` | `Release` | Build mode |
|LLVM_CONFIG| File path string | System default path | Path of `llvm-config` | 
|ONNX_INCLUDE_DIR| Path string | System default path | Path to include directory of onnx |
|ONNX_LIBRARIES| File path string list | System default paths | Path of `onnx` and `onnx_proto` libraries|
|ONNX_LIBRARIE_onnx| File path string | System default path | Path of `onnx` library |
|ONNX_LIBRARIE_onnx_proto| File path string | System default path | Path of `onnx_proto` library |
|ONNX_NAMESPACE| string | `onnx` | Namespace of onnx |
|SKYPAT_INCLUDE_DIR| Path string | `/usr/local/include` | Path to include directory of SkyPat |
|SKYPAT_LIBRARIES| File path string | System default path | Path of `SkyPat` library |
|TARGET_ALL| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to build all targets |
|TARGET_SOPHON| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to build Sophon targets |
|TARGET_X86| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to build X86 targets |
|USE_LLVM| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to use LLVM |
|ENABLE_CLOCK_GETTIME| `ON`,`OFF` | `OFF` | Whether to enable `clock_gettime` function |
|ENABLE_GETTIMEOFDAY| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to enable `gettimeofday` function |
|ENABLE_PTHREAD| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to enable pthread |
|ENABLE_UNITTEST| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to build unit test |
|ENABLE_WERROR| `ON`,`OFF` | `OFF` | Whether to use `-Werror` flag |

Use `cmake -L ..` inside `build` directory to get more detailed options.

# Building with Automake

### Step 1: Configure

```shell
$ ./autogen.sh
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ ../configure --with-llvm=/usr/local --with-skypat=/usr/local --with-onnx=/usr/local --enable-unittest
```

The `--with-llvm`, `--with-skypat` and `--with-onnx` must be replace with the install paths of your llvm, SkyPat and onnx libraries. In common case, you can try `/usr/local`.

It will create `build` directory, get into it and configure your build.

### Build

```shell
$ make -j4
```

It will compile sources with 4 threads concurrently. You can modify `-j4` option to meet your needs.

### Test

```shell
$ ./tools/unittests/unittests
```

It will run all unit tests.

## Advanced configurations

You can override default configurations by simply add `ENTRY=VALUE` options to the configure command. The `ENTRY` and `VALUE` can be replaced according to the following table.

Some options have "Alias" property. That means the value of this option will be an alias variable for other options in defalt value or description.

For options with `yes`/`no` value, it's unnecessary to provide value. If you do so, it will act as `yes`.

Example: `../configure --enable-unittest` will build unit tests even you don't type in `../configure --enable-unittest=yes` way, but `../configure` won't build unit tests.

"Path string" of value means you have to provide a string of a directory path, and "File path string" means you have to provide a string of a file path.

| Entry | Available values | Default | Description | Alias |
|-------|------------------|---------|-------------|-------|
|--prefix| Path string | `/usr/local` | Path to install architecture-independent files | PREFIX |
|--exec-prefix| Path string | PREFIX | Path to install architecture-dependent files | EPREFIX|
|--bindir| Path string | EPREFIX/bin | Path to install user executables | |
|--libexecdir| Path string | EPREFIX/libexec | Path to install program executables | |
|--libdir| Path string | EPREFIX/lib | Path to install object code libraries | |
|--includedir| Path string | PREFIX/include | Path to install C header files | |
|--program-prefix| string | | Prepend to installed program names | |
|--program-suffix| string | | Append to installed program names | |
|--program-transform-name| string | | Run `sed` with value string to modify installed program names | |
|--enable-werror| `yes`,`no` | `no` | Compile with -Werror enabled | |
|--enable-debug| `yes`,`no` | `no` | Turn on debug | |
|--enable-unittest| `yes`,`no` | `no` | Build unit tests | |
|--enable-clock_gettime| `yes`,`no` | `no` | Turn on clock_gettime | |
|--enable-gettimeofday| `yes`,`no` | `yes` | Turn on gettimeofday | |
|--enable-targets| `x86`, `all` | `all` | `all` to build all target, or specific host targets with comma-separated list | |
|--with-pthreads| `yes`,`no` | `yes` | Use pthreads | |
|--with-skypat| Path string | PREFIX | Path of SkyPat to use | |
|--with-onnx| Path string | PREFIX | Path of onnx to use | |
|--with-onnx-namespace| string | `onnx` | Namespace of onnx | |
|--with-llvm| Path string | PREFIX | Path of llvm to use | |

Use `../configure --help` inside `build` directory to get more detailed options.
